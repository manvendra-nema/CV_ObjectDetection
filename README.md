# 📦🔍 Object Detection Project

Welcome to the **Object Detection Project**! In this tutorial, we dive into the world of object detection using the powerful YOLOv5 model. We'll guide you through data preparation, model training, evaluation, and analysis to achieve accurate detection results.

## 🌟 Task Overview

### 0. 📂 Data Preparation
1. **Download the SVHN Dataset** in YOLO format.
2. **Split the dataset** into train, validation, and test sets.
3. **Initialize Weights & Biases (WandB)** for experiment tracking.

### 1. 🔧 Fine-tuning an Object Detector
1. **Train a YOLOv5 model** using pre-trained weights from a specified repository.
2. **Log training progress** with WandB.
3. **Evaluate the model's performance** on the test set:
   - Report class-wise IoU, mean IoU (mIoU), Average Precision (AP), and mean Average Precision (mAP).
   - Plot the Precision-Recall (PR) curve.
   - Report performance metrics using AP@[0.50:0.5:0.95], AP50, and AP75.

### 2. 🎨 Data Augmentation Techniques
1. **Apply suitable data augmentation techniques** to enhance model generalization.
2. **Train the object detection model** with augmented data.
3. **Report performance metrics** including IoU, AP, and mAP on the test set.

## 🌟 Highlights
- **YOLOv5 Model**: Train an object detector using the state-of-the-art YOLOv5 model.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model performance with class-wise IoU, mIoU, AP, mAP, and PR curve.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilize data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
